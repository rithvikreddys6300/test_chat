## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Changing the AI Provider or Model

#### For OpenRouter:
Edit the `model` parameter in the `callOpenRouterAPI` function in `script.js`:
```javascript
model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo', // Change to other OpenRouter models like 'gpt-4', 'claude-3-sonnet', etc.
```

#### For Google Gemini:
The model is set to `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` by default. To change it, modify the URL in the `callGeminiAPI` function:
```javascript
// Change 'gemini-1.5-flash-latest' to other Gemini models like 'gemini-pro'
const response = await fetch(`https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?key=${apiKeys.gemini}`, {
```

### Modifying the System Prompt
Update the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` variable in `script.js` to change the AI's behavior and focus areas.

### Styling Changes
Modify `style.css` to change colors, fonts, or layout. The design is fully responsive and uses modern CSS features.

## üîí Security & Privacy

- API keys are stored locally in your browser only
- No data is sent to any server except your chosen AI provider (OpenRouter or Google)
- All communication is encrypted (HTTPS)
- No tracking or analytics included
- You can clear stored API keys anytime using the Settings button

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**: Make sure your API key is valid and has sufficient credits/quota
   - For OpenRouter: Check your account at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
   - For Google Gemini: Check your API usage at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. **Network Error**: Check your internet connection
